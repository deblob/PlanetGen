# PlanetGen
 A tool for procedurally generating 2-dimensional images of alien planets. My first attempt at procgen.
 
 When launched you will be presented with a rather uninspired looking form, in which you can tweak a variety of settings about how the final image is going to look. Most options in the list, once clicked on, will show a little description of what they do. The name of the output file can be specified at the bottom left and the image will always be saved in the same folder as the .exe
 I recommend turning off the blur for trabants by changing *TRABANT_BLUR_RADIUS* to 0.
 
 There is still a lot to do with the code and I have a lot of ideas I'd still like to implement, but for now it's sadly on ice.
